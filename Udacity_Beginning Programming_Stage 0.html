        <b> Web Browsers, Internet, and Servers </b>
        <p>
          Web browsers are what the end users see. The Internet is a compilation of HTML documents that
          communicate with each other. Servers are where the database are stored. 
        </p>

      <div class = "HTML">
        <b> HTML </b>
        <p>
          HTML stands for <em> Hypertext Markup Language.</em> It is the language that runs computers. It
          tells what the computer should do, say and look like. To have this much control on the computer
          is a <em>really</em> powerful knowledge!

      <div class = "Inline vs. Block">
        <b> Inline vs. Block </b>
        <p>
          Inline are tags that are displayed without line breaks. Block tags have an invisible box around
          them, and normally start and end with a new line.
        </p>
        <p> 
          The following are inline elements: a, br, em, b, img, span
          <br> The following are block elements: p, div, and whaterver <em> form </em> is. (We haven't
          covered that yet.)
        </p>

      <div class = "Linking">
        <b> Linking </b>
        <p>
          There are link tags that link one HTML file to another. For example, <a href = "wwww.udacity.com"> Udacity </a>
          <br> Another example is linking using images. For example, <img src ="https://encrypted-tbn3.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcRuIGeJXEN1sGhE2KdBA9xujM8htfsbOg9hiwZtE_ag9mqDEh-Tgg" alt = Frida with monkeys>
